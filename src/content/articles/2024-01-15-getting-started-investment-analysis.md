# Getting Started with Investment Analysis

## The Foundation of Patient Investing

Investment success isn't about timing the market or finding the next hot stock. It's about developing a systematic approach rooted in three core principles: **patience**, **analysis**, and **long-term thinking**.

## Building Your Investment Framework

### 1. Patience Over Speed
Markets reward those who can wait. Every decision should be made with a multi-year horizon in mind.

### 2. Analysis Over Intuition
Every investment thesis must be grounded in thorough research and systematic evaluation of fundamentals.

### 3. Long-term Over Short-term
Building wealth requires time. Focus on fundamental value rather than short-term market noise.

## Performance Tracking

The predictions above will be tracked and updated based on market outcomes. This creates accountability and helps identify patterns in thinking that workâ€”and those that don't.

## Next Steps

This systematic approach to documenting investment thinking will evolve over time, creating a valuable record of learning and decision-making processes.
